  ##  :hammer_and_wrench: Features Under Development: 
- Hey! I'm continuing to develop the project.
- Data binding will be removed and replaced with view binding.
- Architectural errors in the MVVM architecture will be fixed, and the architecture will be rebuilt.
- UI designs will be improved.
- Unnecessary libraries will be cleaned up.
